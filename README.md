## Description

- This Webpage allows those who visit the chance to look up a City and get the current weather and also the 5 day weather forecast, it will also save your recent searches and populate them as button to go back to if need be.

- This site was built to help me start a Webpage from scratch, nothing but an empty screen, it was a challenge but I believe it's good work.

- This challenge helped me understand how to start writing code from scratch, how to apply different functions in JS, and how to create elements into the html file
